## Purpose

This guideline provides a repeatable, comprehensive framework for preparing for multi-stage job interviews. It covers:

- What to prepare at each stage
- Document templates and structures
- Research approaches
- Q&A preparation frameworks
- Presentation strategies

---

## Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Consistency** | Same core message across all stages |
| **Progressive depth** | Each stage builds on the previous |
| **Evidence-based** | Every claim backed by specific examples |
| **Audience-aware** | Tailor content to who you're speaking with |
| **Hands-on + Strategic** | Show you can execute AND think big |

---

## Your Core Message Template

Define ONE core message that runs through all stages:

> **"I'm [QUALITY 1] AND [QUALITY 2] - [brief explanation of how these combine]."**

Example:
> "I'm hands-on AND strategic - I see the big picture but will roll up my sleeves to make it happen."

## Quick Reference: What Each Stage Really Tests

| Stage | They're Asking | You're Proving |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| HR/Screening | "Should we invest interview time?" | Basics check out, motivated, professional |
| Hiring Manager | "Can they do the job? Will they fit?" | Competence, collaboration, coachability |
| Technical/Case | "Do they actually have the skills?" | Depth, problem-solving, honesty about gaps |
| Team Interview | "Will they work well with us?" | Collaboration, culture fit, team chemistry |
| Executive/Final | "Are they a long-term bet?" | Strategic thinking, culture, leadership |
