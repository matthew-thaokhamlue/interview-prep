# Stage 3: Technical/Case Assignment Round

> Comprehensive guide for preparing technical interviews and case assignments.

**Prerequisites:** Complete `00_overview_and_foundation.md`, `01_hr_screening_round.md`, and `02_hiring_manager_round.md`
**Personal Data:** Pull from `inputs/00_user_profile.md` — §1 (key numbers for "Why Me" slide and proof points), §2 Stories A/I (0-to-1, multi-agent AI for technical credibility), §3.3 (RICE prioritization example from Story B), §3.8 (PMF & AI product strategy). If needed, enrich with role context from `inputs/02_target_company_role.md` and experience detail from `inputs/01_cv_resume.md`.
**Output:** `03_presentation_slides.md`, `03_case_analysis.md`
**Next Stage:** `04_team_interview_round.md`

## Case Assignment Structure

If given a case assignment, structure your response:

### Presentation Slides Template

```
SLIDE 1: The Opportunity
- Market size and growth
- Key trends
- Why now?

SLIDE 2: The Problem
- Current pain points
- Who experiences them
- Cost/impact of the problem

SLIDE 3: Competitive Landscape
- Current solutions
- Why they fall short
- Gap in the market

SLIDE 4: The Solution
- Your proposed approach
- Key differentiators
- How it solves the problem

SLIDE 5: Roadmap / Prioritization
- Phase 1 (immediate)
- Phase 2 (medium-term)
- Phase 3 (longer-term)
- Prioritization framework used (e.g., RICE)

SLIDE 6: Success Metrics
- KPIs to track
- Targets
- How to measure

SLIDE 7: Risks & Assumptions
- Key assumptions made
- Potential risks
- Mitigation strategies

SLIDE 8: Why Me
- Relevant experience
- Key achievements

## Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Scoring

| Factor | Score | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Reach** | % of users affected | How many people benefit |
| **Impact** | 1-3 scale | How much it matters |
| **Confidence** | % certainty | How sure are you |
| **Effort** | 1-3 scale (inverse) | How hard to implement |

Formula: `(Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

### Other Frameworks

- **ICE** (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
- **MoSCoW** (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
- **Value vs. Effort matrix**

## Technical Round Q&A Preparation

### Common Question Categories

**Category A: Problem-Solving**
- "Walk me through how you'd approach [problem]"
- "How would you prioritize these features?"
- "What would you do if [constraint]?"

**Category B: Domain Knowledge**
- "What do you know about [industry]?"
- "How does [technology/process] work?"
- "What trends do you see in [space]?"

**Category C: Experience**
- "Tell me about a time you [did X]"
- "What's your experience with [tool/method]?"
- "Describe a project you're proud of"

**Category D: Role-Specific**
- For Product: "How do you gather user feedback?"
- For Engineering: "How do you approach system design?"
- For Data: "How do you ensure data quality?"

## Answer Framework: STAR+

| Component | What It Means | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Situation** | Context and challenge | "At [Company], we had [problem]" |
| **Task** | Your responsibility | "I was responsible for [X]" |

## Presentation Tips

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| State assumptions explicitly | Pretend you know everything |
| Use data to support claims | Make unsupported assertions |
| Acknowledge uncertainty | Oversell or guarantee outcomes |
| Show your thinking process | Just present conclusions |
| Invite questions | Rush through without pausing |
| Connect to their specific context | Be too generic |
