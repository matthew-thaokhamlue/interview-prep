# Cross-Stage Frameworks

> Reusable frameworks and content that apply across all interview stages.

**Use with:** All stage files (`01_` through `05_`)
**Purpose:** Prepare once, adapt per stage
**Personal data:** **See `inputs/00_user_profile.md`** — it contains the filled-in versions of all frameworks below (stories, numbers, Q&A, proof points, 30-60-90 plans). If fields are incomplete, derive from `inputs/01_cv_resume.md` and `inputs/02_target_company_role.md`.

## Story Bank Structure

> **your filled-in story bank:** See `inputs/00_user_profile.md` §2 (Stories A–K) and §6 (Story ↔ Question Mapping).

Generic template for 5-7 stories using STAR+ format:

| Story | Situation | Task | Action | Result | Learning | Use When Asked About |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| Story 1 | | | | | | Leadership, influence |
| Story 2 | | | | | | Technical challenge |
| Story 3 | | | | | | Team/collaboration |
| Story 4 | | | | | | Failure/learning |
| Story 5 | | | | | | Customer success |
| Story 6 | | | | | | Conflict resolution |
| Story 7 | | | | | | Results/metrics |

---

## Story Categories (Prepare Once, Adapt Per Stage)

| Category | # Stories | Use When |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Leadership/Influence | 2-3 | HM, Team, Executive |
| Technical Excellence | 2-3 | Technical, HM |
| Cross-Functional Collaboration | 2-3 | All stages |
| Problem-Solving | 2-3 | Technical, Case, HM |
| Failure/Learning | 1-2 | HM, Executive |
| Innovation/Initiative | 1-2 | All stages |
| Metrics/Impact | 2-3 | All stages |
| Conflict Resolution | 1-2 | HM, Team |

## STAR+ Answer Framework

| Component | What It Means | Example |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Situation** | Context and challenge | "At [Company], we had [problem]" |
| **Task** | Your responsibility | "I was responsible for [X]" |
| **Action** | What you did (specific) | "I [specific actions taken]" |
| **Result** | Quantified outcome | "[Metric] improved by [X%]" |
| **+Learning** | What you'd do differently | "Looking back, I'd also [Y]" |

### STAR+ Timing Guide

| Component | Time Allocation | Tips |
|-----------|-----------------|------|
| **Situation** | 15% (~20 sec) | Set context quickly, include stakes |
| **Task** | 10% (~15 sec) | Clarify YOUR responsibility |
| **Action** | 50% (~1 min) | Be specific, use "I" not "we" |
| **Result** | 20% (~30 sec) | Quantify, show impact |
| **+Learning** | 5% (~10 sec) | Show growth mindset |

---

## Proof Points (Rule of 3)

> **your proof points:** See `inputs/00_user_profile.md` §1 (Key Numbers). Adapt the framing per role, but use real numbers.

Have three concrete achievements ready:

| Claim | Proof | Metric |
|-------|-------|--------|
| "I build [X]" | [Company/Project] | [Specific number] |
| "I deliver [Y]" | [Company/Project] | [Specific number] |
| "I create [Z]" | [Company/Project] | [Specific number] |

---

## Your Numbers (Memorize)

> **your numbers:** See `inputs/00_user_profile.md` §1 (Key Numbers table). These must stay consistent across all interviews.

| Category | Metric |
|----------|--------|
| Team size led | |
| Budget managed | |
| Users/customers impacted | |
| Revenue influenced | |
| Efficiency gains | |
| Project scale | |

---

## Universal Questions (Prepare Once)

> **your prepared answers:** See `inputs/00_user_profile.md` §3 (Universal Q&A Bank) for polished, ready-to-use answers to all questions below. Adapt with company-specific hooks but never contradict the core answers.

### About You
- Walk me through your background → *Commons §3.1*
- What are your strengths/weaknesses? → *Commons §3.5*
- Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
- What motivates you?

### About the Move
- Why are you looking? → *Commons §3.1 (with Asia/EU variants)*
- Why this company? → *Commons §3.1 framework*
- Why this role?
- What are you looking for?

### About Work Style
- How do you handle conflict? → *Commons §3.7*
- Describe your ideal manager
- How do you prioritize? → *Commons §3.3*
- How do you handle ambiguity? → *Commons §3.3*

## The Bridge Narrative (For Industry/Role Pivots)

| Previous Experience | Target Role |
|--------------------|-------------|
| [Skill/context A] | → [How it applies] |
| [Skill/context B] | → [How it applies] |
| [Skill/context C] | → [How it applies] |

### Pivot Story Template

> "In [previous context], I [did X] which required [transferable skill]. At [target company], you need someone who can [apply that skill to Y]. The domain is different, but the core capability is the same: [underlying principle]."

### Addressing the "Why" Question

- Lead with genuine interest in the new domain
- Connect to long-term career trajectory
- Show you've done homework on the transition
- Reference transferable wins with metrics

---

## Prioritization Frameworks

### RICE Scoring

| Factor | Score | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Reach** | % of users affected | How many people benefit |
| **Impact** | 1-3 scale | How much it matters |
| **Confidence** | % certainty | How sure are you |
| **Effort** | 1-3 scale (inverse) | How hard to implement |

Formula: `(Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort`

### Other Frameworks

- **ICE** (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
- **MoSCoW** (Must, Should, Could, Won't)
- **Value vs. Effort matrix**

---

## The Humility-Confidence Balance

### Humility Signals
- "I need to learn [X] from your teams"
- "I want to understand before I change"
- "Some assumptions may be wrong - that's why I validate first"

### Confidence Signals
- "I've done this before - [specific example]"
- "I have a clear framework for approaching this"
- "I'll hold myself accountable to specific metrics"

---

## Red Flags to Avoid (All Stages)

| Don't Say | Why It's Bad | Say Instead |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| "I'll fix [Company]" | Implies current team failed | "I'll build on what's working" |
| "At [Previous Company] we..." | Can sound condescending | "I've seen approaches that might work here" |
| "The roadmap should be..." | You don't know enough | "Based on my research, I'd explore..." |
| "[Technology] will solve everything" | Overselling | "[Technology] with proper oversight can help" |
| "I need a big team" | Scares budget-conscious leaders | "I'll start lean and scale based on results" |
| Criticizing competitors by name | Unprofessional | Focus on your strengths |
| Guaranteeing specific numbers | You don't have the data | "Here's my framework for estimating" |
| "I don't have weaknesses" | Lacks self-awareness | Acknowledge real growth areas |
| Badmouthing previous employer | Red flag for attitude | Focus on what you learned |

---

## Weakness Framework

> **your prepared weakness answers:** See `inputs/00_user_profile.md` §3.5 for two ready-to-use options: (1) Impatience with long decision cycles, (2) Going too deep into technical details.

### Choosing a Weakness
- Pick something real but not disqualifying
- Show self-awareness
- Demonstrate active improvement
- Connect to the role appropriately

### Weakness Answer Structure
1. Name the weakness honestly
2. Give a brief example of how it showed up
3. Explain what you're doing to improve
4. Share evidence of progress

### Example
> "I tend to be overly detail-oriented, which can slow down decision-making. I noticed this when [specific example]. I've been working on this by [specific actions]. Recently, [evidence of improvement]."
