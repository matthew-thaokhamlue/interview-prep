## Competitive Defense Framework

For leadership roles, expect questions about competition:

### Competitive Analysis Structure

| Competitor | Why Dangerous | Their Weakness | Your Counter |
|------------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| [Name] | [Capability/resources] | [Gap or limitation] | [Your advantage] |

### Moat Assessment

**Strong Moats (Defensible):**
- Exclusive partnerships
- Proprietary data
- Network effects
- Regulatory advantages
- Deep customer relationships

**Weak Moats (Copyable):**
- Features
- UI/UX
- Pricing
- Generic technology

**Strategy:** Double down on strong moats, win through speed on weak moats.

### Competitive Q&A Template

**"What if [Big Player] enters?"**
> "[Player] is a real threat. Here's how we defend:
> 1. **Speed** - Lock in customers before they arrive
> 2. **Data** - Every customer compounds our advantage
> 3. **Specialization** - We go deep where they go wide
> 4. **Unique assets** - [Something they can't replicate]"

**"What can we learn from [Competitor]?"**
> "[Competitor] does [X, Y, Z] well. We should adopt:
> 1. [Specific practice]
> 2. [Specific approach]
> But they're vulnerable on [A, B, C] where we're stronger."

## Cultural Navigation

### Universal Tips

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Show respect for seniority | Dismiss experience |
| Be confident but not arrogant | Oversell or over-promise |
| Acknowledge what exists | Act like you'll "fix" everything |
| Listen more than speak | Dominate the conversation |
| Ask thoughtful questions | Have no questions prepared |

### The Humility-Confidence Balance

**Humility signals:**
- "I need to learn [X] from your teams"
- "I want to understand before I change"
- "Some assumptions may be wrong - that's why I validate first"

**Confidence signals:**
- "I've done this before - [specific example]"
- "I have a clear framework for approaching this"
- "I'll hold myself accountable to specific metrics"

---

## Questions to Ask Them

### Strategic Questions (Show you think big)
1. "What does success look like for this role in [timeframe]?"
2. "What's the biggest risk you see in the next [timeframe]?"
3. "How do you see [strategic priority] evolving?"

### Operational Questions (Show you're practical)
4. "Who would I work with most closely?"
5. "What's the current team structure?"
6. "Are there any pending decisions I'd need to address immediately?"

### Relationship Questions (Show you care about fit)
7. "What management style works best here?"
8. "What would make you say 'hiring [me] was the right decision' in a year?"

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

| Don't Say | Why It's Bad | Say Instead |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| "I'll fix [Company]" | Implies current team failed | "I'll build on what's working" |
| "At [Previous Company] we..." | Can sound condescending | "I've seen approaches that might work here" |
| "The roadmap should be..." | You don't know enough | "Based on my research, I'd explore..." |
| "[Technology] will solve everything" | Overselling | "[Technology] with proper oversight can help" |
| "I need a big team" | Scares budget-conscious leaders | "I'll start lean and scale based on results" |
| Criticizing competitors by name | Unprofessional | Focus on your strengths |
| Guaranteeing specific numbers | You don't have the data | "Here's my framework for estimating" |
